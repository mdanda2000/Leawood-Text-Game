# Leawood Text Game
This is a Java-based console application for creating text-based games. The gameplay is not hard-coded, instead, this engine inputs the map from a text file. 

## Input Files
This game requires two input files, one for the map and another for the key locations. The game map is stored in an array--not as objects--for simplicity.
